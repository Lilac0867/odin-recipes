    <h2 class="title small">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shortening</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons cocoa</li>
      <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>

    <h2 class="title small">Steps</h2> <!-- Need to add list of steps -->
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease two 9-inch round pans.</li>
      <li>Make the cake: Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and shortening together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine red food coloring and cocoa to make a paste; add to creamed mixture.</li>
      <li>Mix buttermilk, salt, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a small bowl. Add flour, alternating with buttermilk mixture, mixing just until incorporated.</li>
      <li>Mix vinegar and baking soda together; gently fold into cake batter and pour into prepared pans.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Inver carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Make the icing: Heat milk and flour in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick. Set aside to cool completely.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, beat sugar, butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading consistency. Frost cake layers when completely cool.</li>
    </ol>
